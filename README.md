# SoftKG: Building a Comprehensive Software Knowledge Graph from Papers

## Introduction

The **SoftKG** project proposes a modular, extendable ontology to sustainably manage software data. By leveraging automation through Large Language Models (LLMs), it extracts software metadata from unstructured sources like scientific papers and version control documentation, integrating these annotations with Wikidata for broad accessibility.
